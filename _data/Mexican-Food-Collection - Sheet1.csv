coll01,coll01.jpg,Tortillas Azules,"Resendiz, Victor",2024-08-11,Blue Corn Tortillas; Mexican Cooking,tortillas,Mexican,Blue Corn Flour,"The photo depicts finished Tortillas Azules or ‘Blue corn tortillas.’ Blue Corn Tortillas are commonly used as the signature tortilla for Mexican street food quesadillas. The blue color comes from a natural variety of blue corn that is found throughout Mexico and the American Southwest. When made into quesadillas, unlike tacos and other tortilla foods, the blue corn tortilla is shaped into a wide oval, which ‘doubles’ its size and serving. The cultural confusion of this ‘doubling’ is from the Nahuatl origin of the word ‘quesadilla’ and a folksonomy assuming that ‘quesa’ comes from ‘queso.’ One might order a quesadilla in Mexico where the vendor has intended it as a doubled taco, only for the customer to be confused when their order does not come with cheese.","To make tortillas of any corn variety, at least two cups of hot water are needed for two cups of corn flour. While the water is hot, the water is poured incrementally into a bowl of corn flour and then gently whisked into crumbs by hand. After about one and a half cups of water have been poured into the bowl of corn flour, the crumbs are then combined into one dough. More hot water is poured on top of the dough in much smaller increments. Typically, most of the hot water is used when making tortillas. The dough is kneaded for several minutes, then split into smaller dough balls, depending on the desired size. A chef verifies that the dough has been properly made with the ‘smush’ test. A tortilla press and plastic sheets are used to flatten tortillas. A flat pan is used to sear the tortillas on both sides, flipping in small intervals until they puff. After the tortillas are fully ‘cooked,’ they can be stored in a tortillero.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,302 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Salsa Verde is an essential dish to many Mexican and Mexican American foods. The salsa itself is a blended salsa of roasted onions, garlic, tomatillos, poblanos, jalapenos, cilantro, and other spices to make a signature green salsa. This salsa can either be very smooth or barely blended, as well as having varying degrees of spice. As a side dish, it is the ‘green salsa’ that accompanies street tacos, but it is also a salsa for simmering steak, a salsa for Enchiladas Verdes, or a salsa to combine with fried tortillas for Chilaquiles Verdes.","Salsa Verde can have many different bases depending on the chef or region of cuisine. Some bases for Salsa Verde begin with blending roasted jalapeno, serrano, and poblano chili peppers and roasted onions and garlic. Other bases for Salsa Verde begin by blending roasted tomatillos and adding degrees of spice with jalapeno, serrano, arbol and poblano chili peppers. Another base for Salsa Verde forgoes roasting to instead simmer tomatillos and chili peppers in a stove pot before blending. With herbs and other spices, each of these methods produce a Salsa Verde, though no specific method is unique to any given region or Mexican or Mexican American cuisine.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,296 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Guajillo Salsa is a bedrock dish in Mexican and Mexican American food. Guajillo Salsa is typically poured over tortilla-based foods or as a marinade, Guajillo Salsa is the flavor base of chorizo, steak, adobo and other meats. The salsa itself consists of rehydrated or seared guajillo chili peppers, ancho chili peppers, arbol chili peppers, or chipotle chili peppers, and roasted onion, tomatoes, and garlic and other spices.","To make Guajillo Salsa, dried guajillo chili peppers are either seared until blistered or rehydrated in a large stock pot. Guajillo Salsa can include ancho, arbol, and chipotle chili peppers that are also either rehydrated or seared to blister individually or together. After either the hydrating process or searing processes, the ingredients are blended with roasted onions, tomatoes, and garlic and other spices to make the salsa, which is typically a flavorful, spicy salsa.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,364 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Chicken Tinga is chicken breast simmered in blended chipotle peppers in tomato and chicken broth. The flavor of Chicken Tinga is very spicy chipotle, roasted tomatoes, sautéed onions, and many herbs. Chicken Tinga can be eaten alone or used as a filling or topping for other Mexican dishes.","To make Chicken Tinga, sliced onions are first sauteed in a deep pan or pot. Once the onions are properly golden, diced tomatoes, spices, and herbs are added. Other roasted vegetables and chipotle chili peppers are blended together with cups of tomato and chicken broth to finish the flavor base. The fresh tomato and chicken broth with blended chipotle chili peppers is added into the same pan or pot with onions and diced tomatoes. Raw chicken breast is placed into the broth and the pan or pot is covered. With the heat low, the chicken is simmered until it is fully cooked. Once cooked safely, the chicken breast is taken out of the broth and set into a bowl for shredding. After all the chicken has been shredded, it is all placed back into the broth and mixed evenly with the onion and tomatoes.

Adobo Chicken or Chicken Al Pastor is chicken breast baked with a very expanded guajillo chili pepper marinade. Much like making a Guajillo Salsa, many of the same ingredients are simply doubled for more servings, however, the ‘adobo’ requires the addition of achiote paste or achiote powder and several fruit juices. The finished adobo is a marinade of pureed guajillo, ancho, and chipotle chili peppers blended into orange and pineapple juice along with many herbs and other spices. The particular red color of the ‘adobo’ comes from achiote (annatto) color. It is also common to see this dish used as a baked chicken substitute of pork-based Al Pastor. It is also common to see ‘Al Pastor A La Gringa’ where this food is sold, in reference to the American palette of chicken as an alternative for pork.","The ‘adobo’ marinade of Adobo Chicken or Chicken Al Pastor requires many ingredients that expand upon a basic Guajillo Salsa. The essential ingredients of Guajillo Salsa are increased to fit a bigger marinade for baked chicken servings, along with the inclusion of several tablespoons of achiote paste or achiote powder and half-cups or whole cups of orange and pineapple juice, to include adding extra tablespoons of oil and vinegar. With the ‘adobo’ blended and in a fridge container, the chicken is placed inside to marinate for at least eight hours, but no longer than one night as the acidity of the marinade can spoil the meat. The chicken can be baked with excess ‘adobo’ spread around it, and when finished, Adobo Chicken can be served alone or used as a filling or topping.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,323 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

The long history of calling Arroz Mexicano ‘Spanish Rice’ can be explored in other materials, but the rice itself is simply rice simmered with some degree of tomato paste, tomato broth, or some combination of tomatoes or tomato flavor and chicken broth and other spices. It is also common for Arroz Mexicano to be served with carrots and peas mixed in, though these additions are not as signature to the dish as the depth of tomato ingredients used to make it.","To make Arroz Mexicano, one method is to begin by roasting tomatoes, onion, and garlic, and then combining the ingredients with tomato broth powder (consommé) and chicken broth in a blender to blend until smooth. In a large pot, the rice is toasted until it is aromatic and slightly golden. Then, the fresh tomato broth is poured into the pot to the desired amount, and with the heat set low, the pot covered, the rice is simmered until soft. Often carrots and peas are added while the rice simmers.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,333 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Enchiladas belong to a family of rolled tortillas filled specifically with chicken or red meat. Enchiladas, meaning ‘in chili pepper salsa,’ references that the rolled tortillas are covered in a red or green salsa, and this also describes the filling as well. Green enchiladas, Enchiladas Verdes, denotes that the tortillas in green salsa are filled with chicken. Red enchiladas, Enchiladas Rojas, describes that the tortillas in red sauce have either ground beef or pork in them. It is common to find that when enchiladas are sold, the change of expected filling becomes part of the name, such as Enchiladas Rojas rellenas de Huevo or Enchiladas Verdes rellenas de Poblano and so on.","To make enchiladas, the ‘color’ of salsa is made beforehand and prepared in a large quantity to cover multiple servings of rolled tortillas. Many of the fillings can be made beforehand or at the start of cooking. The cooking method of enchiladas varies between filling and rolling the enchiladas and dipping them into a hot pan of salsa or baking them in salsa with a crust of cheeses. In the case of ‘green’ enchiladas, there is another method of adding avocado and cream to the ‘green’ salsa for a ‘Swiss’ variety of ‘green’ enchiladas, Enchiladas Suizas. These different methods of making enchiladas can mean very different textures of either crispy, creamy, or sauced tortillas, along with the changes in how much extra dairy is used inside the filling, inside the salsa, or as a baking crust.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,360 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Enmoladas are a special variety of enchiladas that instead of typical ‘green’ or ‘red’ salsa, mole is used to cover the rolled tortillas. Because this dish uses mole, the pairing of toppings typically used with mole are also used, such as Cotija cheese, sesame seeds, and white onion. The method of preparing Enmoladas is almost always to dip them into mole sauce and not bake them.","To make Enmoladas, a large quantity of mole is made beforehand. As with regular preparations of enchiladas, the tortillas are rolled and filled with chicken but are fried and ‘cooked’ before dipping them into a pan of mole or having mole poured over them.

Tostadas are made by frying whole tortillas and layering them with refried beans and then adding egg or meats along with many toppings. The layers of Tosadas can begin with refried pinto beans or refried black beans, but these layers do not signify that a different kind of meat will be added on top of the beans or that the toppings will be different. What is perhaps surprising is that the kinds of toppings may show a difference between regions of cuisine. Regardless of the meat or beans being used, whether cabbage or lettuce is placed as a topping may signify that the Tostadas are made favoring a Mexican American palette with lettuce or a Mexican palette with cabbage. In fact, the choice of cabbage or lettuce as a topping for many Mexican foods may reflect a shift in class, immigration status, globalization, and other larger economic factors.","To make Tostadas, a whole tortilla is fried until crispy. Refried black beans or refired pinto beans are then spread over the fried tortilla. A layer of cheese might be added to melt while the refried beans are still hot.

Sopa de Arroz y Pollo or Sopa de Arroz con Pollo is part of a family of ‘Arroz y Pollo’ or ‘Arroz con Pollo,’ chicken and rice foods that exists across Latin America and Spain. The Mexican soup Sopa de Arroz y Pollo means Mexican rice that is made either with a much larger amount of tomato broth so that it is stewed or a soup base of tomato broth that has Mexican rice added to it. In both cases, the chicken is prepared in a separate stock pot and simmered until it can be shredded and added into the soup and rice. This is the preferred method as taking out the espuma, the ‘foam’ that appears during boiling or simmering chicken, would otherwise make the tomato broth cloudy if the ingredients were all prepared in one pot. Other ingredients such as diced potatoes, carrots, and many toppings are commonly added to the soup. Other varieties of ‘Arroz y Pollo’ can mean very different preparations of chicken and rice, along with the inclusion of Mediterranean ingredients such as olives.","To make Sopa de Arroz y Pollo, either the original broth used to prepare Mexican rice can be increased or doubled, or a separate tomato broth can be prepared by first sautéing onions and dice tomatoes in a pot and then filling that pot with broth and other spices. Because boiling or simmering chicken creates ‘foam,’ the chicken is usually prepared in its own stock pot with onion, bay leaves, and other spices, until it reaches temperature and is then shredded. If made beforehand, the Mexican rice is added into the fresh broth along with the shredded chicken. If the Mexican rice is made with extra broth, the broth and rice simmer until ready, and then the shredded chicken is added. Once served, toppings such as cabbage and lettuce, avocado, table cream, jalapeno slices or whole jalapenos can be added for more flavors and textures.",image/jpg,Image;StillImage,416 KB,1200 x 1200,No Copyright,All permissions for copying and reproducing allowed.

Sopa Azteca is more commonly known as Tortilla Soup in the United States. Both names refer to the fact that the signature ingredient of this soup is not pasta or rice but fried tortilla strips and shredded chicken. In the United States, extra ingredients that signify an American palette or Southwestern flavor might be added to the soup, such as black beans, kidney beans, lettuce, and cheeses common to the United States, along with using a broth of less chili pepper varieties. Mexican Sopa Azteca might be made with a tomato-based broth of guajillo, ancho, chipotle, and arbol chili peppers along with cheeses and herbs from Mexico, but an American or Southwestern Tortilla Soup might be made with only jalapenos as slices, herbs common to the United States, and familiar to American cheese toppings. In either case, a tomato-based broth with fried tortilla strips and added shredded chicken are the essential ingredients of Sopa Azteca or Tortilla Soup.","To make Sopa Azteca, a tomato broth is prepared either by roasting all the necessary vegetables and blending them, or by sautéing onions, garlic, and tomatoes and adding chicken broth and other spices to a large pot.
